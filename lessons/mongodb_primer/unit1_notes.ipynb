    "Welcome to my intro to MongoDB with Python. MongoDB is a tool that helps you explore data without requiring it to have a strict, known structure. Because of this, you can handle diverse data together and unify analytics. You can also keep improving and fix issues as your requirements evolve. Most application programming interfaces - or APIs - on the web today expose a certain data format. If you can express your data in this format, then you can get started with MongoDB. Here's what I mean:\n"
