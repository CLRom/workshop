A basic website walkthrough (40min) was pre-recorded and is
[online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg9AgpwoArQ) on MP's YouTube channel.

We expect participants to view the above prior to the workshop so that a more
advanced interactive walkthough can happen during the workshop. Assets for that
walkthrough should be placed in this folder, though data files (if any) should
be placed in this repo's `mp_workshop/data_files folder`.
