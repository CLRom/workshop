    "\n",
    "Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is the code that powers all of the scientific analysis behind the Materials Project.  It includes a robust and efficient libraries for the handling of crystallographic structures and molecules, in addition to various mathematical and scientific tools for the handling and generation of materials data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.0 Core functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things you can do with pymatgen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create, identify, and manipulate crystal structures and molecules\n",
    "- Write input and output files for most electronic structure codes\n",
    "- Analyze density of states, bandstructures, X-ray diffraction spectra\n",
    "- Perform tensor-based analysis, including elastic and piezoelectric tensors\n",
    "- Characterize the local chemical environment of structural sites\n",
    "- Create pourbaix diagrams and phase diagrams\n",
    "- Match crystal structures to each other and perform symmetry analysis\n",
    "- Match substrates based on geometry and elastic behavior\n",
    "- Create and manipulate surfaces\n",
    "- Do unit conversions\n",
    "- Get basic information about chemical identity\n",
    "- Includes a wide variety of other analysis tools, including estimating the cost of a material based on chemical abundance, or its geographical distribution of elements\n",

    "## 0.1 How do I install pymatgen?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the workshop, pymatgen has been pre-installed for use in your Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, pymatgen can be installed via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install pymatgen`\n",
    "\n",
    "or conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install --channel matsci pymatgen`\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using Python 3.6 or above. Until 2018, pymatgen was developed simultaneously for Python 2.x and 3.x, but following the rest of the Python community we are phasing out support for Python 2.x, and will be developing exclusively for Python 3.x from version 2019.1.1.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **For general help:** [pymatgen Google Groups mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pymatgen) is a place to ask questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **To report bugs:** The [Github Issues](https://github.com/materialsproject/github) page is a good place to report bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For Materials Project data and website discussions:** The Materials Project  has its community [Materials Project Discussion](https://discuss.materialsproject.org) forum. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **For more example notebooks:** [matgenb](http://matgenb.materialsvirtuallab.org) is a new resource of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various pymatgen functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want specific new features, you're welcome to ask! We try to respond to community needs. If you're a developer and can add the feature yourself, we actively encourage you to do so by creating a Pull Request on Github with your additional functionality. To date, pymatgen has seen over 15,000 commits and over 100 contributors, and we try to have an inclusive and welcoming development community. All contributors are also individually acknowledged on [materialsproject.org/about](https://materialsproject.org/about).\n"
