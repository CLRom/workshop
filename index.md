### Before the Workshop

Please review our [website walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg9AgpwoArQ) video (approx. 40 minutes) so that you understand basic techniques for searching and layout of information. This way, we can avoid such a walkthrough during the workshop and spend more time on interactive instruction and exercises.

If you are not attending our Python primer on Wednesday afternoon and wish to verify/refresh your Python skills, we have pre-recorded the second half of the primer -- covering lists; sets and dictionaries; comprehensions; and functions. Feel free to [watch any segments online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTjFYVNE7LTiJBX4IYu_XY3C5kRUZLnn6) prior to Thursday.

To follow along with the primer videos above, you may:

1. First, [sign in](https://materialsproject.org/) to your MP account online. Register for an account first if needed.
2. Next (you *must* be signed in to MP), open a new web browser tab/window and go to [https://jupyterhub.materialsproject.org/](https://jupyterhub.materialsproject.org/).
3. Then, start your server (big green button).
4. Finally, open a new Python 3 notebook from the **New&#x25bc;** button on the right side of the shown notebook directory.

You can now follow along in your notebook with the Python primer videos. There is a **User Inerface Tour** option in the **Help** menu at the top of your new notebook to get you familiar with the Jupyter notebook interface for writing, editing, and executing Python code in cells.

<img src="static/img/warning.png" alt="WARNING" width="75px"> **Warning**: Do *not* depend on our jupyterhub for saving your notebooks or data. We are still developing the instructional environment, so the server may reset at *any* time prior to commencement of the workshop.

The most convienient parking garage nearby is the [Stadium Parking Garage](https://lots.impark.com/imp#details=37,386) (also known as Maxwell Garage) on the east (uphill) edge of campus at 2175 Gayley Road, with a daily (up to 10 hrs) rate of $15. A walking route from the garage to 190 Doe Library is shown below.
