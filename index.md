### Before the Workshop

Please review our [website walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg9AgpwoArQ) video (approx. 40 minutes) so that you understand basic techniques for searching and layout of information. This way, we can avoid such a walkthrough during the workshop and spend more time on interactive instruction and exercises.
