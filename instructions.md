    You can now follow along in your notebook during the workshop. There is a **User Interface Tour** option in the **Help** menu at the top of your new notebook to get you familiar with the Jupyter notebook interface for writing, editing, and executing Python code in cells.
5. Go to our [Etherpad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/mpworkshop) and follow instructions there. You will be asked to share code snippets and exercise answers here.
6. Make sure you have one pink and one yellow/green sticky note. This is for sticking on the top of your laptop to indicate to us that you are done with an exercise / ready to move on (green) or you are working on an exercise / need help (pink).
