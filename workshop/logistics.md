## Before the Workshop

### Virtual Poster-Session

We'll host a virtual poster-session via a YouTube video for lightning summaries and a FigShare repository with associated DOI for citation. Please [email](mailto:shyamd@lbl.gov):

- your poster PDF
- a 1-minute lighting video explaining the main concept behind your poster. This shouldn't be detailed summary of your work, but rather a high-level description that everyone can listen to and then decide which posters they want to focus on such as an elevator-pitch.

We'll host the lightning-videos on our YouTube Channel and publish the PDFs on FigShare with a DOI that everyone can cite for this poster session.

### Setup Instructions:

1. [Sign in](https://materialsproject.org/) to your MP account online. Register for an account first if needed.
2. [Sign in](https://cocalc.org) to an account on CoCalc using the same email address you registered with. This will be the online python service we'll use to work interactively.
